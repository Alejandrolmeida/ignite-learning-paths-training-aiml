## Session Abstract

**Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges**

Abstract: As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using Artificial Intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers. Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. In this session, we will show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to extract insights from retail data. Weâ€™ll go into the neural networks behind computer vision, and show how you can augment the pre-built AI with your own images for custom image recognition applications.
