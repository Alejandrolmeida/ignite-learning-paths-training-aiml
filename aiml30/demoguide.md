# Live Demo Steps
Make sure you have completed the [demo setup steps here](demosetup.md)

## Demo One - Data Prep Demo with App
In the first demo we are highlighting the data preparation that was discussed in the slides for Time Series models. Now walk them through how we are doing this in the C# demo app. Make sure to highlight that this can be done in any language.

1. Open the `IgniteAimlDataApp` App. I personally like to have this open before I start the talk so I can just flip to it.
2. Open the `Program.cs` file
3. [Here](assets/DataPrepDemo.mp4) is video of the demo without sound. This is also included in the slides if there are any issues with doing it live.
4. [Here](https://youtu.be/u1ppYaZuNmo?t=751) is this segment from the Train the Trainer video with sound for the demo.

2. create new experiment
3. Build model
